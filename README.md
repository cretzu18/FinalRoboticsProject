# Instant Camera

## General description

The Instant Camera project is a modern, DIY take on the classic [instant camera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant_camera). It a small device that lets you take photos, see them on a screen, save them digitally, and print them out instantly onto paper just like an old Polaroid. The project is built around the ESP32-CAM microcontroller.

## Tutorial source

I will follow this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lnDPz4QZjQ) to learn the basics of how to talk to the thermal printer. But my project will add more features:
  - A Selfie Mode: the code detects  the physical flip and automatically mirrors and rotates the image sensor data
  - Live Viewfinder: on the TFT Screen
  - Digital Gallery: the user can browse photos and choose which ones to reprint directly from the device
